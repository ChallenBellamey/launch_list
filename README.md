## Design Modifications

As only a desktop layout design was provided, I have made some off-the-cuff design decisions to make the application responsive and improve display on tablet and mobile layout devices, as well as to add some UI improvements such as hover effects and transitions. I thought it inappropriate to request approval on these design modifications given the context of the exercise, but in a commissioned application for a client I would of course discuss these design modifications with the designer and/or product owner.
